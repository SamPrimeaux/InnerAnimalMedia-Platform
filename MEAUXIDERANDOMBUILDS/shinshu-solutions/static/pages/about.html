                            Shinshu Solutions is a Nagano-based bilingual consulting service operated by Jake Waalk, 
                            specializing in supporting foreign real estate investors and Japanese construction firms. 
                            I help international clients navigate the practical realities of buying, renovating, and 
                            maintaining property in Japan.
                        </p>

                            My service area is centered on the world-class ski resort Nozawa Onsen, which was featured 
                            on the cover of Condé Nast Traveler as one of the world's top 9 ski resorts for the 2026 season. 
                            I also work in the surrounding region including Iiyama, Shinano, Myoko, Karuizawa, and nearby resort areas.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I relocated to Nagano Prefecture after earning my Master's Degree in Anthropology in 2015. 
                            Since then, I have amassed wide-ranging professional experience in Nagano across both the 
                            public and private sectors. I worked as an English teacher on the JET Program, serving two 
                            years as President of Nagano AJET.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            From 2020 to 2021, I was employed by Tomi City on ecotourism development at the Tomi Tourism 
                            Association, where I became the first non-Japanese Town Development Officer in Nagano Prefecture. 
                            More recently, I worked in the Japanese mushroom industry, handling marketing and international 
                            client management for a Nagano-based export firm.
